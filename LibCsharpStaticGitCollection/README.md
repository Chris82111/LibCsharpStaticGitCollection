# LibCsharpStaticGitCollection

This [repository](https://github.com/Chris82111/LibCsharpStaticGitCollection) offers a convenient, cross-platform solution for using Git
in a portable form for Linux and Windows. As a powerful wrapper, it abstracts
the complexity of Git integration and enables quick and easy integration into
existing development environments.

Integration can be done either directly via NuGet.org or by cloning the
repository. This allows the package to be used flexibly either as a direct
reference or to set up your own local NuGet package feed - ideal for
controlled build environments and enterprise applications.
